What's up with this project?

Chorenivore is the (working) title of a to-do list application I'm working on. It's based on some older tutorials I found and I'm branching out to add more functionality.

It's also serving as my first ADVENTURE into github.

To do:

A way to toggle between Yes/No in the Finished? column from the view
Making flash notices disappear after a few seconds
If there are no tasks, the view will not display the Task / Description / Finished? columns. Instead display something along the lines of "Nothing has been entered yet. Create some tasks!"
Change all instances of task to chore, to fit with the name.
Display age of tasks in the view, then allowing users to sort by age.

Second commit

Editing a task now redirects to tasks_path rather than @task
Deleting a task now notifies the user the task has been deleted
