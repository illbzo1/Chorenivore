What's up with this project?

Chorenivore is the (working) title of a to-do list application I'm working on. It's based on some older tutorials I found and I'm branching out to add more functionality.

It's also serving as my first ADVENTURE into github.

To do:

A way to toggle between Yes/No in the Finished? column from the view
Making flash notices disappear after a few seconds
If there are no tasks, the view will not display the Task / Description / Finished? columns. Instead display something along the lines of "Nothing has been entered yet. Create some tasks!"
Change all instances of task to chore, to fit with the name.
Display age of tasks in the view, then allowing users to sort by age.

Second commit

Editing a task now redirects to tasks_path rather than @task
Deleting a task now notifies the user the task has been deleted

Added a date column

I've added a Created column to the task view. Not sure if I want to keep it in this format, or figure out a way to subtract created_at from time.now and just show the age of the task. My thinking is if I had a way to calculate the age of a task, I could set up a way to flag tasks that are a certain age, such as a week or a month, and automatically mark them as higher priority. This is all blue-sky solutioneering at this point, however!

Added button technology

Pretty big update. jar helped me out and showed me a way to update a task's done status in the view using a hidden field and some buttons. So I fired up Illustrator and Photoshop and made some custom buttons. I've also formatted the date using an initializer. I've been thinking about adding a multi-step task functionality, that would allow a user to create a task with multiple steps, then display a percentage of the task completed in the view as a user completes steps.

View update

The view no longer shows the headings for tasks unless a task has been created. I woke up this morning with the idea to use a partial to solve this problem and lo and behold it works! Is it elegant? I don't know! Does it work? YES

First styling

Added some quick styling, mostly to improve the display of the Tasks table. I may have gotten a little carried away trying to sex this thing up prematurely. I also took the boolean task.finished? field out of the view, since that information is handled by the hidden field and the form_for buttons. Speaking of buttons, I edited them to have a transparent background, as well. I'd forgotten they had a white background until I started messing around with the CSS.
